# H-0007: RDP Lateral Movement from Non-Standard Sources

**Hunt Metadata**

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Hunter:** ATHF AI Assistant
- **Status:** planning
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1021.001

## LEARN: Prepare the Hunt

### Hypothesis Statement

Adversaries use compromised credentials to authenticate via RDP from non-standard source hosts to multiple internal systems during off-hours, bypassing administrative jump boxes to establish persistent access and enable lateral movement

### Threat Context

This hypothesis targets post-compromise lateral movement where attackers leverage stolen credentials to move through the environment. By focusing on RDP connections that deviate from normal administrative patterns (non-jump box sources, off-hours activity, rapid sequential connections), we can identify credential abuse before attackers establish deeper footholds. Multiple rapid connections suggest reconnaissance or automated lateral movement tools.

### ABLE Scoping

| **Field**   | **Your Input** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Actor** *(Optional)* | Adversaries with compromised credentials (ransomware operators, APT groups, insider threats) |
| **Behavior** | RDP authentication (Logon Type 10) from unexpected source hosts to multiple internal systems during off-hours or in rapid succession (3+ hosts within 30 minutes), bypassing standard administrative jump boxes |
| **Location** | Internal Windows systems, workstation-to-workstation or workstation-to-server RDP connections, non-jump box sources |
| **Evidence** | Windows Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 10, Event ID 4625 for failed attempts, network flow logs showing internal RDP traffic (port 3389), authentication logs with source/destination IP pairs, timestamps for temporal analysis |

# H-0009: Domain Account Enumeration from Workstations

**Hunt Metadata**

- **Date:** 2026-01-14
- **Hunter:** AI Assistant
- **Status:** planning
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1087.002

---

## LEARN: Prepare the Hunt

### Hypothesis Statement

Adversaries use native Windows enumeration commands and PowerShell cmdlets from non-administrative workstations to discover domain accounts and privileged groups for lateral movement preparation

### Threat Context

Domain enumeration is a critical reconnaissance phase that precedes credential theft and lateral movement. Detecting this activity early provides an opportunity to identify compromised accounts before attackers escalate privileges or move laterally. Non-administrative users executing these commands from standard workstations represent high-fidelity indicators of compromise.

### ABLE Scoping

| **Field**   | **Your Input** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Actor** *(Optional)* | Post-compromise adversary or insider threat |
| **Behavior** | Execution of domain enumeration tools (net.exe, dsquery.exe, PowerShell AD cmdlets) from non-administrative endpoints, querying domain controllers for user/group information, targeting privileged groups |
| **Location** | Standard workstations (non-privileged access workstations or IT management systems) |
| **Evidence** | Process execution telemetry (process.file.name, process.cmd_line, process.parent_process), Windows Security Event logs (4661/4662 if enabled), network connections to domain controllers on LDAP ports (389/636) |

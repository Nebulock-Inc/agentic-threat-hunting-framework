# H-0005: Process Injection Defense Evasion Detection

**Hunt Metadata**

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Hunter:** Sydney Marrone
- **Status:** planning
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1055

---

## LEARN: Prepare the Hunt

### Hypothesis Statement

Adversaries use process injection techniques to inject malicious code into high-privilege legitimate processes like svchost.exe, explorer.exe, and lsass.exe for defense evasion and persistence

### Threat Context

Process injection (T1055) is actively used by Emotet, TrickBot, and Cobalt Strike. Research R-0005 identified telemetry gaps in module loading events (50-80% population rates).

### ABLE Scoping

| **Field**   | **Your Input** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Actor** *(Optional)* | Commodity malware (Emotet, TrickBot), post-exploitation frameworks (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit), APT groups |
| **Behavior** | Injection of malicious code into high-privilege legitimate processes using DLL injection, process hollowing, APC injection, and thread hijacking |
| **Location** | Windows endpoints - High-privilege processes (svchost.exe, explorer.exe, lsass.exe) |
| **Evidence** | Sysmon Event IDs 7 (module load), 8 (remote thread), 10 (process access); EDR memory scanning events; Unsigned DLLs from unusual paths; Cross-process memory operations |

### Threat Intel & Research

# H-0006: LSASS Memory Dumping via Legitimate Tools

**Hunt Metadata**

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Hunter:** AI Assistant
- **Status:** planning
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1003.001

---

## LEARN: Prepare the Hunt

### Hypothesis Statement

Adversaries use legitimate Windows utilities and offensive security tools with elevated privileges to access LSASS process memory and extract cached credentials for lateral movement within domain environments

### Threat Context

LSASS credential dumping is a critical post-exploitation technique that enables adversaries to harvest credentials for lateral movement and privilege escalation. Detecting LSASS access attempts provides visibility into credential theft operations before widespread compromise occurs. This technique is frequently observed in ransomware operations, APT campaigns, and insider threats targeting Active Directory environments.

### ABLE Scoping

| **Field**   | **Your Input** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Actor** *(Optional)* | Generic post-exploitation adversaries (ransomware operators, APT groups, insider threats) |
| **Behavior** | Process access to lsass.exe with PROCESS_VM_READ permissions, rundll32.exe executing comsvcs.dll MiniDump function, procdump.exe with -ma flags, creation of dump files in non-standard locations |
| **Location** | Windows endpoints and servers in domain environments, focusing on endpoints with interactive user sessions and cached domain credentials |
| **Evidence** | Windows Security Event 4656/4663 (process access), Sysmon Event ID 10 (ProcessAccess with GrantedAccess 0x1410/0x1438/0x1010), Sysmon Event ID 11 (FileCreate for *.dmp files), EDR process telemetry showing lsass.exe access attempts |

### Threat Intel & Research

- **MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:** T1003.001 (OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory), T1003.002, T1003.003, T1003.006, T1055, T1106
- **Research Document:** R-0006 - LSASS memory dumping credential theft techniques
- **CTI Sources & References:**
  - Common tools: Mimikatz, ProcDump, Comsvcs.dll (rundll32 technique), PowerSploit
  - Key evasion methods: Direct system calls, PPLdump (PPL bypass), process cloning/forking

## OBSERVE: Expected Behaviors

### What Normal Looks Like

- Legitimate administrative tools creating LSASS dumps during authorized troubleshooting with documented change tickets
- Security scanning tools (Qualys, Nessus, EDR agents) performing compliance checks and memory scanning
- Windows Error Reporting (WerFault.exe) generating crash dumps in C:\Windows\Temp\
- Authorized penetration testing with documented approvals
- System administrators using ProcDump from standard admin tool directories with SeDebugPrivilege
- Task Manager creating dumps during incident response by SOC/IR teams

### What Suspicious Looks Like

- rundll32.exe executing comsvcs.dll with MiniDump function targeting lsass.exe PID
- procdump.exe/procdump64.exe executed from non-standard locations (temp directories, user profiles, network shares)
- Dump files (*.dmp, *.dump) created in unusual locations outside C:\Windows\Temp\
- mimikatz.exe or known credential dumping tools (sekurlsa.dll, pypykatz, nanodump)
- PowerShell commands invoking MiniDumpWriteDump API or directly accessing lsass memory
- Process access to lsass.exe from unexpected parent processes or unsigned binaries
- Elevated privilege token usage (SeDebugPrivilege) for processes without business justification
- Dump file creation followed by immediate compression (.zip), encryption, or exfiltration

### Expected Observables

- **Processes:**
  - lsass.exe (target process, PID typically 500-700)
  - rundll32.exe, procdump.exe, taskmgr.exe, mimikatz.exe, powershell.exe
  - Command lines: `procdump -ma lsass.exe`, `rundll32 comsvcs.dll MiniDump <PID>`, `sekurlsa::minidump`
- **Network:** N/A (primarily local process activity, though dump files may be exfiltrated subsequently)
- **Files:**
  - Dump files: *.dmp, *.dump, lsass*.zip in temp directories, user profiles, network shares
  - Suspicious paths: C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Temp\, C:\Temp\, \\network-share\
- **Registry:** N/A
- **Authentication:**
  - Elevated privilege usage (SYSTEM, Administrator accounts)
  - SeDebugPrivilege token manipulation prior to LSASS access

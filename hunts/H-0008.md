# H-0008: Suspicious LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon Persistence on macOS

**Hunt Metadata**

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Hunter:** AI Assistant
- **Status:** planning
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1543.001

---

## LEARN: Prepare the Hunt

### Hypothesis Statement

Adversaries create or modify LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon plist files outside of standard installation workflows to establish persistence on macOS systems

### Threat Context

Detection gaps exist around programmatic plist manipulation without launchctl usage and post-installation modifications to existing plists. These behaviors bypass traditional detection methods that focus on launchctl commands.

### ABLE Scoping

| **Field**   | **Your Input** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Actor** *(Optional)* | Generic adversary (malware droppers, APT groups targeting macOS) |
| **Behavior** | Direct file creation/modification in persistence directories (/Library/LaunchAgents/, /Library/LaunchDaemons/, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/) by unexpected processes or with suspicious timing patterns |
| **Location** | macOS endpoints, specifically persistence directories |
| **Evidence** | EDR file creation/modification events, plist files with RunAtLoad/KeepAlive keys, parent processes performing writes, timing correlation with installation events |

### Threat Intel & Research

- **CTI Sources & References:** [Links to reports, blogs, etc.]
